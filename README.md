# Requirements

* Responsible User
* Ubuntu 16.04 x64 atleast 2 vCPU
* Putty/Bitvise
* XMR Wallet Address


# Recommendations

**XMR Wallet Address**

```FreeWallet.org``` 

FreeWallet.org has its own CrytoCurrency Converter, Much Easier to convert from XMR to BTC

**vCPU Usage: 80**

```80 or Less```

This will decrease the risk from being detected by the VPS Providers

**Threads**

```Maximum vCPU - 2```

If you are using a 6vCPU Machine, you can only allocate a Maximum of 4 Threads

This will also decrease the risk from being detected and to ensure that you dont overlap your vCPU Usage Limit

Example with Computations:

6vCPU - 2 = 4

( 4/6 ) * 100 = 66.67

66.67 is less than 80 

This means that your XMR-Miner is working below the Recommended vCPU Usage

Lesser vCPU Usage, Less Risk of Being Detected


**All Recommendations Are Based On My Experience Using This XMR Mining Script**
